Configurations for different printers for PrusaSlicer

The first PrusaSlicer config bundle is for Sapphire Plus (with standard hotend).

Also added golang "script" which converts PrusaSlicer gcode thumbnail (prepared for Prusa Mini) to
Robin nano MKS firmware format. Can be used as outout filter directly.
